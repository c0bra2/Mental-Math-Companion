Discription:
	Exercise your mental math skills by practicing for only minutes a day, if you spend enough time with this program you're going to become one hell of a number crunching wizard! >.>

The GUI is rather straight forward and intuitive in my opinion so i will not be "walking you through" ever single button.
This project was actually inspired by some mental math lectures (TTC - Secrets of Mental Math) and i developed this program to practice my newly aquired skills. I hope this benifits you as much as does me.

Required:
1)python 2.5
2)pygame

Todo:
1)Add more features
2)clean up the code
